Hello!

Here are some important things to know about this demo application:
- JS and CSS assets are compiled with Laravel Mix (`npm run production`)
- The profile editor includes a Vue.js component that auto-saves biography edits
- The production instance of this demo is loaded with Mailgun credentials so the new user email feature can be tested.

Thanks for taking a look at it.
